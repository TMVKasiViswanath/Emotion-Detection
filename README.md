# Emotion Detection Project
This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural networks. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with seven emotions - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.

# Dependencies
- python3, [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/)<br>
- To install the required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Basic usage
The repository is currently compatible with `tensorflow-2.0` and makes use of the Keras API using the `tensorflow.keras` library.

- Firstly clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/TMVKasiViswanath/Emotion-Detection.git
